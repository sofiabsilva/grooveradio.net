# GrooveRadio.NET responsive website

Revamping the Grooveradio.net static website, added a custom radio player (similar to the chrome extension I've built before).
Done after watching the first 2 lectures of "CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript", practiced using bootstrap and Sass.
This would be the course work for project 0, but I decided not to follow all the required specs (having 5 different html pages) because I figured it wouldn't fit this website.

A big challenge for this one was making sure it was somewhat compatible with most browsers. As of now it is working and tested for Chrome (mobile and web), Firefox, IE11 and MS Edge.
